The Ping Pong game is implemented using the Raylib library. In this game, players 
use small paddles to hit a light ball back and forth on a screen that is divided into 
two parts. The goal of the game is to get points by hitting the ball so it bounces on 
the other player's side of the screen in a way that they can't hit it back.
